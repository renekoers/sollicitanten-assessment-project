Project Sylveon

The goal of this project is to develop an application that will test if a candidate has some skills in programming and how fast they can learn new things.
The test consist of some levels. The goal of each level is to get the character to the finish using code. The candidate can build this code using pre-written code blocks. There are no restrictions on how much they want to use a certain block, but the final scores depends on this usage. 
After taking the test you can see the result of this test on the admin page. There will be an overview on how well the candidate did on each level.


This project is currently in progress. Their are some things that are not fully implemented yet, such as:
- There is no verification yet for logging in on the admin page.
- The tutorial needs to be completed.
- There are only 3 levels yet and this should be extended.
- There are no levels yet that require handling new information.
- The results only shows the amount of lines and the duration of the best solution (this is the solution with the minimal amount of used lines) and how many attempts the candidate needed in order to get to this solution. This will be extended and improved.
- The statistics can only be viewed via bar charts. There will be more options in the future.
- Some logic needs to be moved to different file (this is currently under progress).
